      As Martin Fowler once said,
      <q
        >Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good
        programmers write code that humans can understand.</q

          "In the journey to becoming a better coder, one of the best practices
          is keeping your code clean and readable. Imagine you are writing your
          code not just for computers but for humans as well. This will not only
          improve your coding skills but also make maintenance easier." - Robert
          C. Martin

    <p>Here's an example of clean code:</p>
    <pre><code>function calculateArea(radius) {
    return Math.PI * radius * radius;
}</code></pre>
    <p>Press <kbd>Ctrl + S</kbd> to save your work regularly.</p>
    <p>
      Sample output: <samp>Area calculated: 78.54</samp> (assuming radius is 5).
