    <p>As Albert Einstein once said:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited.
        Imagination encircles the world. The true sign of intelligence is not
        knowledge but imagination."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This quote speaks to the idea that creativity and original thinking are
      more important than simply accumulating knowledge. It suggests that being
      able to see beyond what is already known and to imagine new possibilities
      is a key characteristic of intelligence.
